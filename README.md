# This is my Capstone Research Project Repository
This repository contains all my current research findings dealing with my topic.

My topic is __Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)__. 

## My Current Research Direction:
1. Survey of Quantum Neural Networks
    * Explore the history, foundational concepts, and recent advances in QNNs.
    * Compare various architectures of QNNs (e.g., Variational Quantum Circuits, Quantum Convolutional Networks).
    * Summarize key breakthroughs and limitations in QNN development.

2. Technical Analysis: How QNNs Differ from Classical Neural Networks
    * Focusing on an aspect of my choice (one of the following):
      * Training methodologies (gradient descent in QNNs vs. classical approaches).
      * Hardware constraints (quantum hardware limitations vs. GPU/TPU acceleration).
      * Expressiveness and computational efficiency (where QNNs might offer advantages).

3. Future Trends in QNN Research and Applications
    * What are the upcoming developments in QNNs over the next 6-12 months?
    * Industry adoption: Are companies like IBM, Google, or Microsoft investing in QNNs?
    * What challenges need to be solved before QNNs can compete with classical networks?

4. Demonstration: Prototyping or Simulating a QNN
    * Use a simulator like Qiskit or PennyLane to implement a QNN.
      * Possibly implementing QNN in a Multi-Agent System (MAS) with Dr. Srikanth
    * Compare the performance of your QNN to a classical NN.
